# Logic:
I think its sliding window.
eg. abcab
We keep adding element to right; => left = 0, right = 1, map = {a=0}
Now, we update the left pointer to prev index of the recently added element; => left = map[element[right]] if element[right] is not null.
We update the map which stores the last index of that element; => map = {a=0, b=1}

# DSA:
Sliding window
Map

# Time complexity:
O(n)

# Space complexity:
O(n)
